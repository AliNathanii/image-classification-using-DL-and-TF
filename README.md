# Dog Breed Classifier

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs into different breeds using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset is divided into training and validation sets, and data augmentation techniques are applied to improve model performance. The model's accuracy is evaluated, and the predictions are visualized.
